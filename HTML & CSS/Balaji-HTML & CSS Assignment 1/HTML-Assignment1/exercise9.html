            HyperText Markup Language or <a id="html">HTML</a> is the standard markup language for documents designed to
            be displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
            technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
            multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues
            for its appearance.
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
            interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured
            documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and
            other items
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as directly introduce content
            into the page. Other tags such as surround and provide information about document text and may include
            sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
            content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content

            <a id="php">PHP</a> is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development. It was
            originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993 and released in 1995.The PHP
            reference implementation is now produced by the PHP Group. PHP was originally an abbreviation of Personal
            Home Page but it now stands for the recursive initialism

        </p>
        <p>Early PHP was not intended to be a new programming language, and grew organically, with Lerdorf noting in
            retrospect: "I don't know how to stop it, there was never any intent to write a programming language [...] I
            have absolutely no idea how to write a programming language, I just kept adding the next logical step on the
            way." A development team began to form and, after months of work and beta testing, officially released
            PHP/FI 2 in November 1997.

            The fact that PHP was not originally designed, but instead was developed organically has led to inconsistent
            naming of functions and inconsistent ordering of their parameters. In some cases, the function names were
            chosen to match the lower-level libraries which PHP was "wrapping", while in some very early versions of PHP
            the length of the function names was used internally as a hash function, so names were chosen to improve the
            distribution of hash values</p>

        <p>PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or a
            Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP
            code—which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data—would form the whole or part
            of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist
            that can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response.</p>
        <p>The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License.
            PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on a variety of operating systems and
            platforms.</p>

        <p>W3Techs reports that as of January 2023, "PHP is used by 77.8% of all the websites whose server-side
            programming language we know." It also reports that only 8% of PHP users use the currently supported 8.x
            versions.</p>
